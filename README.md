# React Vite Meme Generator App

## Project Overview
I am learning React and decided to build a meme generator using React. In order for the project to be deployed I used Vite as well.  My Vite/React project is javaScript + SWC. 

I am doing a Bootcamp with [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) in which on of the projects was to create the meme generator. I expanded on what I learned and transformed the project to my own. It is very basic and simple, but every time the user presses the Generate button a new meme will show up. 

I loaded the api from [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api) because I wanted to learn from the documents about what the best plan was to utilize the api. It was easier than I expected when I read the documentation and learned what all I could use. I did not use all aspect because since it is for learning I didn't want to pay the premium to search the images for correct ones. 

## Learning
Started learning React about 2 weeks ago, it has been a steady build of the library. Since I have dived in to JavaScript it was easier to under React. Using props and state is easier to create website faster than vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have only begun to understand React and have a long way to go, but I am confident if I continue to find projects to create I will become a mid-level React Developer.  

- Event listeners
- State
- Conditional rendering
- Forms
- Side Effects
- Props

## Resources
- [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com)
- [React.dev](https://react.dev/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

## What to improve
I would like to get better at coding within React and use the premium aspect of [imgflip](https://imgflip.com/api) so I utilize the search_memes or ai_meme. I think this will add to the excitement and fun of the Meme Generator App.
